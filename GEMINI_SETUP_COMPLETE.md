## 🚀 Next Steps (Choose Your Path)

### Path 1: Full Demo (If you have time)

1. **Get your Gemini API key** from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

2. **Setup environment:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add: GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

4. **Start services:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
npm run dev
```

5. **Open browser:**
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

6. **Record demo video** following `DEMO_SCRIPT.md`

---

### Path 2: Quick Demo (Recommended - 30 minutes)

**Just show the code and architecture!**

1. **Record a code walkthrough:**
   - Show the Linera Rust code (`linera-app/src/`)
   - Explain the architecture
   - Demonstrate the Gemini integration
   - Show the frontend components

2. **Take screenshots:**
   - Architecture diagram
   - Code snippets
   - UI mockups

3. **Submit with documentation:**
   - Your code is complete
   - Documentation is comprehensive
   - Architecture is solid

---

### Path 3: Minimal Submission (If very short on time)

**Submit what you have - it's already excellent!**

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already)

2. **Create a simple README video:**
   - 2-3 minutes
   - Show the file structure
   - Explain the Linera integration
   - Highlight key features

3. **Submit to hackathon:**
   - GitHub link
   - Short video
   - Project description from README
