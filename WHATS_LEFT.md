## ‚è≥ Remaining Tasks (Optional)

### Task 15: Integration and End-to-End Testing (Optional)

These are **optional testing tasks** that are not required for the hackathon submission but would be valuable for production:

#### 15.1 Set up test environment
- Deploy Linera node on local devnet
- Configure Solana devnet RPC
- Set up test database and Redis
- Create test Twitter accounts and mock data

#### 15.2 Implement end-to-end test scenarios
- Test complete flow: tweet ‚Üí signal ‚Üí strategy match ‚Üí trade execution ‚Üí fill recording ‚Üí dashboard update
- Test multi-relayer coordination
- Test wallet connection and signature verification
- Test backtesting with historical data

#### 15.3 Perform load and performance testing
- Test 100 signals per minute throughput
- Test 50 concurrent active strategies
- Verify <5 second end-to-end latency
- Test dashboard updates within 2 seconds

**Status**: Not required for MVP, can be added post-hackathon
